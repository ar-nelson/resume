## Technical Skills

I am a full-stack developer with 15 years of professional experience. My experience is primarily in Java, Scala, HTML/CSS, Typescript, Node, and React, though I have used dozens of other languages and technologies in professional, academic, and hobbyist projects. I love learning new languages and platforms, and I adapt to unfamiliar systems quickly.

## Personal Projects

**Tapir** (2023-present) · https://github.com/ar-nelson/tapir

A Mastodon-compatible single-user federated social microblogging server, written in Typescript for Deno. Implements ActivityPub and the Mastodon API. Due to Deno's limitations, I wrote my own database layer and dependency injection library. A rewrite in Java is in progress.

**Ludwig** (2023-present) · https://github.com/ar-nelson/ludwig

A Reddit-style forum server, written in C++ with LMDB and HTMX. Compatible with Lemmy, and implements the Lemmy API.

**Schemepunk** (2020-2021) · https://github.com/ar-nelson/schemepunk

A portable standard library for R7RS Scheme. It is compatible with 7 Scheme dialects, and implements or polyfills 27 modules, including data structures, console pretty-printing, and a Datalog engine.

While building this library, I participated in the SRFI mailing lists, a standardization process for Scheme libraries that has been ongoing since the 90s. I have authored two standards documents: SRFI 197¹ and SRFI 214².

**Osmosis** (2020-2021) · https://github.com/ar-nelson/osmosis-js

A peer-to-peer data synchronization library for native apps. Keeps mobile and desktop copies of an app in sync whenever they connect to the same network. Uses encryption and a custom JSON CRDT. A prototype is currently written in Node.js, but I plan to rewrite it in C.

While developing this library, I published several sublibraries³⁴⁵ as small standalone Node packages.

**Jaspr** (2017) · https://github.com/ar-nelson/jaspr

A new programming language implemented on top of Node.js. A Clojure-esque Lisp with immutable JSON as its core data structure. Designed with an async-by-default approach to concurrency.
